The course aims to be succinct in introducing FAIR, its concepts and terminology, and supplements all material with signposting to useful FAIR resources.  These resources include [RDMkit](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/), [FAIR Cookbook](https://faircookbook.elixir-europe.org/content/home.html), [RDMbites](https://www.youtube.com/@elixir-uk/playlists),  [FAIRsharing](https://fairsharing.org/) and the [Data Stewardship Wizard](https://ds-wizard.org/).  These are some of the suite of [resources](https://elixir-europe.org/platforms/interoperability/rirs) and [services](https://elixir-europe.org/services/tag/interoperability-and-standards) offered through the [ELIXIR](https://elixir-europe.org/) open-access infrastructure, supporting FAIR research data management.
