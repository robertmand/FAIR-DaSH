With the current expansion of biomedical research data, there was an urgent need to develop guidelines to ensure proper data management. That's why FAIR principles were published to help researchers properly share, reuse, and manage their data. 

Also bear in mind that FAIR principles are not only applied to data but also to software, and workflows. They are easily adapted to different data types and more resources are now available on how to apply FAIR principles to different types of data, algorithms, tools, workflows, and software. 

In this lesson, we will explain FAIR principles and how FAIR principles will help you properly manage your data.

## What is FAIR?
The FAIR publication of 2016 makes reference to the FAIR principles which are:
- F stands for Findable 
- A stands for Accessible 
- I stands for Interoperable 
- R stands for Reusable

> ## These principles were published in

To apply FAIR to your data, each principle has set of specific requirements that guide researchers through the process of FAIRification of their data to make their data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable.

### F in FAIR 
F is the first letter of FAIR, it indiactes findability. To make your data findable, the data should fulfil 4 principles:

> ## To recap
> To make your data **Findable**
> - F1: Metadata and data are assigned globally unique and persistent identifiers**
> - F2: Data are described with rich metadata
> - F3: Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe 
> - F4: Metadata and data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource
{: .keypoints}

> ## Exercise
> After watching this videos, answer the following questions:
> - How many of these principles have you applied to your data?
> - What is metadata?
> - What are persistant identifiers?
> Keep this in mind, we will need this for our next section on FAIRness of data

### A in FAIR
A stands for accessibility to the data

A in FAIR includes 2 main principles:

- A1: (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardized communication protocol

A1.1: The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable

A1.2: The protocol allows for an authentication and authorization where necessary

- A2: Metadata should be accessible even when the data is no longer available

As mentioned in Landi et al. The “A” of FAIR – As Open as Possible, as Closed as Necessary

### I in FAIR
I is related to technical interoperability 

These categories are: 

-	I1: (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation

-	I2: (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow the FAIR principles

-	I3: (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data

### R in FAIR
R indicates reusability which is the last principle of FAIR. 

It included one main category that describes the importance of the use of well-descriptive metadata

- R1: (Meta)data are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes

## What is FAIRification of data?
It is a process of applying FAIR to your data. Your data will be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.
This will be discussed later in detail


## What is FAIRness of data?
When you apply FAIR to your data, you can apply one or more of the principles. FAIRness describes how much your data fulfilled FAIR principles. Usually, you can use one of the assessment tools that will help you know and guide you on how to make your data more FAIR. This will be discussed later in detail.
